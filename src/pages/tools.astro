  {
    question: 'What sleep tools actually work?',
    answer: 'The most effective sleep tools are those that address specific sleep challenges: blackout curtains for light control, white noise machines for sound masking, sleep trackers for habit awareness, and temperature-regulating bedding. We test and review each tool based on scientific research and real-world effectiveness.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need expensive gadgets to sleep better?',
    answer: 'No. Many effective sleep improvements come from free habit changes and low-cost solutions like blackout curtains, earplugs, or a box fan. High-tech sleep trackers and smart devices can provide helpful data but are not essential for most people to improve their sleep quality.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I look for in a sleep tracker?',
    answer: 'Look for accurate heart rate monitoring, sleep stage detection, minimal disruption (comfortable to wear), good battery life, and actionable insights rather than just data. The best tracker is one you will actually use consistently.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are white noise machines worth it?',
    answer: 'For many people, yes. White noise machines help mask disruptive sounds, create consistent audio environments, and can significantly improve sleep quality for light sleepers or those in noisy environments. Even a simple fan can work as an effective white noise source.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I choose the right sleep tools for me?',
    answer: 'Start by identifying your specific sleep challenge (falling asleep, staying asleep, waking too early, poor sleep quality). Then choose tools that directly address that issue. We provide detailed buying guides for each category to help you make informed decisions.',
  },
