Your nightly routine sends powerful signals to your brain about whether it's time to sleep or stay alert. The right habits make falling asleep effortless.

## The 90-Minute Wind-Down Protocol

Don't expect to go from Netflix and phone scrolling to deep sleep instantly. Your brain needs transition time.

### 90 minutes before bed:
1. Dim the lights throughout your home
2. Lower the thermostat by 2-3 degrees
3. Finish eating and drinking caffeine
4. Start your wind-down activities

## Screen Time: The Science-Backed Approach

You don't need to quit screens cold turkey, but you do need boundaries.

### Smart screen strategies:
- Use blue light filters after sunset (built into most devices)
- Switch to red/amber night lights in your bedroom
- Read on an e-reader with warm backlighting instead of a phone
- If you must use screens, keep brightness at 30% or lower

## The Power of Consistency

Your circadian rhythm thrives on predictability. Going to bed and waking up at roughly the same time—even on weekends—strengthens your sleep-wake cycle.

### Consistency tips:
- Choose a wake time you can maintain 7 days a week
- Set a bedtime alarm to remind you to start winding down
- If you must sleep in, limit it to 60-90 minutes max
- Anchor your schedule to daylight exposure in the morning

## Pre-Sleep Rituals That Signal Rest

Create a repeatable sequence your brain associates with sleep.

### Effective rituals:
- 10-15 minutes of gentle stretching or yoga
- Reading a physical book (not a thriller—something calm)
- Journaling or a gratitude practice
- Progressive muscle relaxation or breath work
- Warm (not hot) shower or bath

## What to Avoid Before Bed

These common habits sabotage sleep:
- Intense exercise within 3 hours of bedtime
- Large meals or spicy foods late at night
- Alcohol (it disrupts sleep architecture even if it makes you drowsy)
- Emotionally charged conversations or stressful planning
- Checking email or social media "one last time"

## For Shift Workers and Night Owls

If you work late or have a delayed sleep phase, you need a more intentional routine:
- Use bright light exposure at your "morning" (whenever you wake)
- Create total darkness during your sleep window with blackout solutions
- Consider strategic naps (20 minutes or 90 minutes—nothing in between)
- Time caffeine carefully to avoid interference with sleep

## Making Habits Stick

Don't overhaul everything at once. Pick one habit, implement it for 2 weeks, then add another. Small, consistent changes compound into transformative results.
