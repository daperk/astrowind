## Understanding Noise Colors

White noise contains all frequencies at equal intensity, creating a consistent "static" sound. Pink noise reduces higher frequencies, producing a deeper, more natural sound similar to rainfall or rustling leaves. Brown noise goes even deeper, resembling the low rumble of thunder or a waterfall.

## What Science Says About Sleep Noise

A 2016 study in *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience* found that pink noise improved deep sleep quality and enhanced memory consolidation in older adults. Participants exposed to pink noise showed increased slow-wave sleep activity, the most restorative sleep stage.

White noise excels at masking sudden environmental sounds—barking dogs, traffic noise, or snoring partners. It creates a consistent acoustic blanket that prevents your brain from being startled awake by volume changes. Research shows white noise can reduce sleep onset time by up to 38% for light sleepers in noisy environments.

## Choosing the Right Noise for You

If you live in a consistently noisy area (city traffic, neighbors), white noise provides superior sound masking. For those in quieter environments seeking deeper sleep, pink noise may enhance slow-wave sleep activity.

## Practical Application

Use a dedicated sound machine rather than phone apps to avoid electromagnetic field exposure near your head. Position the device 6-8 feet from your bed at a comfortable volume—loud enough to mask disruptive sounds but not so loud that it becomes a sleep disruptor itself.
