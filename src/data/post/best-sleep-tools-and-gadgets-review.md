Not all sleep tools are created equal. After testing dozens of products, we've identified the gadgets that truly make a difference in sleep quality—and the overhyped ones to avoid.

## Sleep Masks: Block Light, Improve Sleep

A quality sleep mask can be transformative, especially for shift workers or those sensitive to light.

### Top picks:
- **Contoured 3D masks**: Allow eye movement during REM sleep
- **Weighted silk masks**: Provide gentle pressure for relaxation
- **Bluetooth sleep masks**: Combine light blocking with calming audio

## Red Light Therapy Lamps

Red and amber wavelengths don't suppress melatonin like blue light does, making them ideal for evening use.

### Best options:
- Book lights with red/amber LEDs
- Smart bulbs that shift to warm tones automatically
- Red light therapy panels for pre-sleep wind-down

## White Noise Machines

Consistent background noise masks disruptive sounds and creates a sonic cocoon for sleep.

### What works:
- Dedicated white noise machines (not apps—better sound quality)
- Fans for natural, consistent airflow and noise
- Pink or brown noise for deeper frequency masking

## Sleep Trackers: Data That Matters

Tracking sleep can be useful—if you focus on trends, not nightly obsession.

### Worth considering:
- Oura Ring: Accurate heart rate variability and sleep staging
- WHOOP Strap: Recovery-focused metrics for athletes
- Eight Sleep Pod: Active temperature regulation plus tracking

## Smart Features to Look For

The best sleep tech integrates seamlessly into your routine:
- Gradual sunrise alarm clocks
- Temperature-regulating mattress pads
- Air quality monitors with automated purifiers
- Smart thermostats that lower temperature at bedtime

## What NOT to Buy

Avoid gimmicks like "sleep-inducing" headbands, expensive essential oil diffusers (a $15 one works fine), or tracking devices that create anxiety about sleep.

Invest in tools that solve real problems—light exposure, noise disruption, temperature regulation—not marketing promises.
