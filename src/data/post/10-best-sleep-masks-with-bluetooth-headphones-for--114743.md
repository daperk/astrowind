# 10 Best Sleep Masks with Bluetooth Headphones for 2025

Struggling to fall asleep while your partner snores or your noisy neighbors throw another late-night party? A sleep mask with Bluetooth headphones might be the game-changer you need. These innovative sleep tools combine light-blocking capabilities with the soothing power of music, meditation apps, or white noise—all without uncomfortable earbuds digging into your ears as you sleep.

In 2025, these sleep-enhancing gadgets have reached new heights with improved battery life, better sound quality, and designs specifically engineered for side sleepers. Let's explore the best sleep masks with Bluetooth headphones that can transform your bedtime routine tonight.

## Quick Verdict: Our Top Picks

Short on time? Here's our verdict: The **Manta SOUND Sleep Mask** ($79.99) takes the crown for premium quality with its ultra-thin speakers designed for side sleepers, 100% blackout capability, and triple battery life compared to competitors. For budget-conscious sleepers, the **MUSICOZY Sleep Headphones** ($24.99) offers exceptional value with decent sound quality, a comfortable fit, and over 18,000 positive reviews on Amazon.

Both options will dramatically improve your sleep quality—your choice depends on your budget, sleeping position, and specific needs.

## What to Look for in Sleep Masks with Bluetooth Headphones

Before diving into specific products, let's understand what makes a great sleep mask with Bluetooth headphones worth your investment.

### Speaker Placement and Comfort

The placement of speakers within the mask can make or break your sleep experience. Premium models like the **Manta SOUND** feature adjustable speaker positions that accommodate different ear placements and head shapes. This customization ensures you're not stuck with uncomfortable pressure points throughout the night.

For side sleepers, ultra-thin speakers are essential. Traditional headphones create painful pressure points when pressed between your ear and pillow. The best masks for side sleepers, such as the **Manta SOUND** and **Cozyphones** ($29.99), use specially designed flat speakers that remain comfortable even when you're lying on your side.

### Light Blocking Capability

A sleep mask's primary function is to block light, and not all masks perform equally. The **Manta SOUND Sleep Mask** offers 100% blackout capability with its unique eye cup design that prevents any light leakage. This complete darkness signals to your brain that it's time to sleep, triggering natural melatonin production.

The **MUSICOZY** model provides decent light blocking with a contoured design that prevents pressure on your eyelids while blocking most ambient light. However, some users report slight light leakage around the nose area—something to consider if you're extremely sensitive to light.

### Battery Life and Charging

Nothing disrupts sleep like a "low battery" notification in the middle of the night. The **Manta SOUND** leads the pack with triple the battery life of competitors—lasting up to 24 hours on a single charge. Most other models, including the popular **MUSICOZY**, offer 8-10 hours of playback, which is sufficient for a full night's sleep but requires more frequent charging.

Charging speed matters too. The **Lavince Sleep Headphones** ($35.99) features quick-charge technology that provides 2 hours of playback from just 10 minutes of charging—perfect for those who frequently forget to charge their devices.

### Connectivity and Controls

All the sleep masks we've reviewed use Bluetooth 5.0 or newer, ensuring stable connections to your devices. The connection range varies from 30-45 feet, allowing you to leave your phone on a nightstand while maintaining connectivity.

Control panels differ significantly between models. The **MUSICOZY** features intuitive controls on the front of the mask, making it easy to adjust volume, skip tracks, or answer calls without removing the mask. The more premium **Perytong Sleep Headphones** ($39.99) includes voice control compatibility with Siri and Google Assistant, allowing hands-free operation.

## Best Overall: Manta SOUND Sleep Mask ($79.99)

The **Manta SOUND Sleep Mask** represents the pinnacle of sleep mask technology in 2025. What sets it apart is the thoughtful engineering that addresses the most common complaints about sleep headphones.

The ultra-thin, adjustable speakers can be positioned exactly where you need them, ensuring comfort regardless of your ear position or head size. For side sleepers, this is revolutionary—no more painful pressure or having to sleep only on your back.

The eye cups create a perfect blackout environment without pressing against your eyelids, allowing for natural REM sleep. The 100% light-blocking capability makes it ideal for shift workers who need to sleep during daylight hours.

With triple the battery life of competitors, you'll enjoy up to 24 hours of playback on a single charge. The mask also features a "whisper mode" that automatically lowers volume as you fall asleep, gradually fading out when sleep is detected.

At $79.99, it's definitely an investment, but thousands of five-star reviews confirm it's worth every penny for serious sleep enthusiasts.

## Best Value: MUSICOZY Sleep Headphones ($24.99)

The **MUSICOZY Sleep Headphones** has become Amazon's best-selling sleep mask with Bluetooth headphones for good reason. At just $24.99, it delivers impressive performance that satisfies most sleepers' needs.

The contoured design blocks light effectively while preventing pressure on your eyelids. The speakers deliver clear audio that's perfect for white noise, meditation tracks, or gentle music. While audiophiles might find the bass lacking, the sound quality is more than adequate for sleep purposes.

The mask secures with an adjustable Velcro band that keeps it in place throughout the night, even for restless sleepers. The control panel is intuitive, with easily distinguishable buttons that can be operated by touch alone in the dark.

Battery life ranges from 8-10 hours, sufficient for a full night's sleep but requiring regular charging. The machine-washable fabric (after removing the electronics) is a nice bonus for hygiene-conscious users.

With over 18,000 positive reviews, the **MUSICOZY** has proven itself as the go-to affordable option that doesn't compromise on essential features.

## Best for Side Sleepers: Cozyphones Sleep Headphones ($29.99)

Side sleepers face unique challenges when it comes to sleep headphones. The **Cozyphones** addresses these challenges with its ultra-thin speakers embedded in soft fleece material that feels comfortable against your pillow.

Unlike masks with rigid components, the **Cozyphones** features a flexible, breathable design that conforms to your head shape. The speakers can be adjusted within the headband to align perfectly with your ears, preventing uncomfortable pressure points.

The fleece material is particularly beneficial in colder months, providing additional warmth while blocking light and delivering your favorite sleep sounds. For warmer weather, the company offers a breathable mesh version with the same speaker technology.

The trade-off for this comfort is slightly reduced sound quality compared to premium models, but most users find it more than adequate for sleep sounds. Battery life is standard at 8-10 hours, with a quick 2-hour recharge time.

At $29.99, the **Cozyphones** strikes an excellent balance between affordability and specialized comfort for side sleepers who don't want to invest in the premium **Manta SOUND**.

## Best for Travel: Fulext Sleep Headphones ($32.99)

The ideal travel sleep mask needs to be lightweight, durable, and versatile enough to handle different sleeping environments. The **Fulext Sleep Headphones** excels in all these categories, making it our top pick for travelers in 2025.

Weighing just 2.4 ounces, the **Fulext** adds virtually no weight to your travel bag. The flat design folds easily, taking up minimal space in carry-on luggage. The durable outer fabric withstands the rigors of travel while remaining soft against your skin.

What truly distinguishes this mask for travelers is its extended battery life—up to 12 hours of continuous playback—and its quick-charge capability that provides 3 hours of use from just 20 minutes of charging. This is particularly valuable in airports with limited charging time between flights.

The mask includes a travel pouch that protects it from damage and keeps the charging cable organized. The Bluetooth 5.2 technology ensures stable connections even in environments with significant wireless interference, like airplanes and hotels.

The light-blocking capability is exceptional, with a nose baffle design that prevents light leakage—essential for sleeping in varied lighting conditions while traveling. The adjustable strap accommodates different head sizes and can be tightened or loosened depending on your sleeping position.
