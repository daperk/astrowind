# 7 Best Sleep Masks for Side Sleepers in 2025 [Expert Guide]

Are you a side sleeper struggling to find a sleep mask that doesn't press uncomfortably against your face? You're not alone. The quest for the perfect sleep mask becomes even more challenging when you prefer sleeping on your side. Most standard masks create painful pressure points, shift during the night, or let light leak in—completely defeating their purpose.

As a side sleeper myself, I've spent countless nights testing dozens of masks to find the ones that truly deliver on their promises. In this comprehensive guide, I'll reveal the best sleep masks specifically designed for side sleepers in 2025, with options for every preference and budget.

## Quick Verdict: The Best Sleep Mask for Side Sleepers

If you're in a hurry, the **Alaska Bear Silk Contoured Sleep Mask** ($15.99) stands out as our top recommendation for side sleepers in 2025. Its lightweight hybrid silk-foam design creates minimal pressure on temples and ears while providing excellent light blocking. The single silent sliding strap stays put without irritation, making it ideal for restless sleepers.

For those who want premium options with extra features, the **MZOO Luxury Sleep Mask** ($19.99) with its memory foam eyecups and 3D contouring is our premium pick, while budget-conscious shoppers will appreciate the **LKY Digital** multi-pack ($15.99 for three, about $5.33 each).

## What Makes a Great Sleep Mask for Side Sleepers?

Side sleeping presents unique challenges when it comes to sleep masks. The ideal mask needs specific design elements to remain comfortable throughout the night.

### Key Features to Look For:

* **Thin profile at the temples:** Thick masks create uncomfortable pressure points when pressed between your face and pillow
* **Contoured eye cups:** These create space around your eyes and prevent pressure on your eyelids
* **Lightweight materials:** Heavy masks tend to shift during the night
* **Secure but gentle straps:** The right strap design keeps the mask in place without digging in
* **Complete blackout:** Even when compressed slightly, the mask should prevent light leakage

The relationship between quality sleep and darkness is well-documented. According to sleep researchers, even small amounts of light can disrupt melatonin production and affect sleep quality. This makes finding a truly effective sleep mask an essential part of [optimizing your bedroom environment for better sleep](/optimize-bedroom-environment-for-better-sleep).

## The 7 Best Sleep Masks for Side Sleepers in 2025

### 1. Alaska Bear Silk Contoured Sleep Mask

**Price:** $15.99

The **Alaska Bear Silk Contoured Sleep Mask** earns our top spot for its perfect balance of comfort, functionality, and affordability.

**Why we love it:**
* Hybrid design with contoured molded foam interior and silk exterior
* Creates space around eyes, preventing pressure while side sleeping
* Thinner profile at temples avoids compression compared to bulkier masks
* Provides complete blackout even when worn loosely
* No light leakage from nose or sides
* Breathable, cool, and lightweight (under 2 oz)
* Single adjustable sliding strap stays silent and secure

During testing, I found this mask stayed in place all night long without shifting—even with significant tossing and turning. The contoured design means your eyelashes won't brush against the fabric, and the nose area is perfectly shaped to block light without pressing uncomfortably.

The mask is also available in a double-strap version for those who need extra security, though most side sleepers find the single strap sufficient and more comfortable.

### 2. MZOO Luxury Sleep Mask

**Price:** $19.99

The **MZOO Luxury Sleep Mask** is a premium option that has become an Amazon bestseller for good reason.

**Why we love it:**
* Memory foam eyecups with deep sockets prevent any pressure on eyes
* True 3D contouring works with facial contours rather than against them
* Adjustable strap with smooth buckle doesn't catch on pillowcases
* Total darkness guarantee with specialized nose design
* Slightly thicker padding provides extra cushioning

While slightly bulkier than our top pick, the MZOO excels in creating absolute darkness. The memory foam conforms to your face over time, creating a custom fit that's hard to beat. The deeper eye sockets make this a particular favorite for those with long eyelashes or who've had lash extensions.

The only drawback is that some users report the thicker padding can create pressure points after several hours of side sleeping. However, this tends to be less of an issue if you have a softer pillow.

### 3. LitBear Sleep Mask

**Price:** $17.99

The **LitBear Sleep Mask** features an innovative design specifically addressing side sleeper concerns.

**Why we love it:**
* Unique 15° tilted sides reduce temple pressure when side sleeping
* Adaptive nose wing creates a perfect seal without pressure
* Ice silk and memory foam combination balances softness with structure
* Highly breathable materials prevent heat buildup
* Wide, adjustable strap distributes pressure evenly

LitBear's ingenious tilted design makes a noticeable difference in comfort for dedicated side sleepers. The mask feels substantially less intrusive when pressed against a pillow compared to standard designs.

While relatively new to the market, this mask has quickly gained a following among those with sensitive skin who appreciate the ice silk's cooling properties and gentle touch.

### 4. Nidra Deep Rest Eye Mask

**Price:** $13.95

The **Nidra Deep Rest Eye Mask** brings an ultra-lightweight option to our list.

**Why we love it:**
* Extremely lightweight contoured eyecups
* Fits varied face shapes with minimal adjustment needed
* No eye pressure whatsoever—eyelids can move freely
* Soft, flexible materials conform to face
* Simple, effective design with minimal bulk

This mask is particularly well-suited for those who are new to sleeping with an eye mask. Its non-intrusive design feels barely-there while still blocking light effectively. The deep contoured cups allow for normal blinking and even REM sleep movement without any awareness of wearing a mask.

The downside is the hand-wash-only care instructions, which some users find inconvenient. However, the mask's durability makes up for this minor maintenance issue.

### 5. Tempur-Pedic Sleep Mask

**Price:** $25.00

From the makers of premium memory foam mattresses comes the **Tempur-Pedic Sleep Mask**.

**Why we love it:**
* Uses the same pressure-relieving foam as their famous pillows
* Snug, cushioned fit that conforms to facial contours
* Provides complete blackout in any sleeping position
* Remarkably movement-tolerant—stays in place all night
* Premium construction with attention to detail

While this is the most expensive option on our list, the quality is immediately apparent. The proprietary Tempur material conforms to your face better than standard memory foam, creating a personalized fit that improves over time.

The mask is slightly less breathable than silk options, which may be a consideration for hot sleepers. However, for those in cooler environments who prioritize light-blocking effectiveness, this mask is unmatched.

### 6. Alaska Bear 2-Strap Silk Mask

**Price:** $15.99

For those who prefer an ultra-lightweight pure silk option, the **Alaska Bear 2-Strap Silk Mask** is worth considering.

**Why we love it:**
* Ultra-lightweight pure mulberry silk construction
* Double silent sliding straps for secure positioning
* Extremely breathable and cooling
* Works in all sleeping positions
* Gentle on skin and hair—no creases or tangles

This simpler design forgoes contoured eyecups in favor of a flat, ultra-thin profile that creates minimal pressure against pillows. While it doesn't create space for eyes to open, the exceptionally soft silk prevents any discomfort.

The double-strap design is particularly effective for active sleepers who need extra security without compromising on comfort. This mask pairs perfectly with [sleep habits and routines that work](/sleep-habits-and-routines-that-work) for improved sleep quality.

### 7. LKY Digital Sleep Mask (3-Pack)

**Price:** $15.99 for three ($5.33 each)

Our budget pick, the **LKY Digital Sleep Mask** 3-pack, offers surprisingly good performance at an unbeatable price point.

**Why we love it:**
* Excellent value—three masks for the price of one premium option
* Good geometry with concave eye sections
* Soft, adjustable elastic strap
* Lightweight and machine washable
* Perfect for travel or guests

While these masks don't quite match the light-blocking effectiveness of our premium picks when compressed against a pillow, they perform admirably for the price. Having multiple masks is also convenient for travelers or those who prefer to wash their mask frequently.

The slightly looser fit means these masks may shift more during the night, but for occasional use or as a starter option, they provide excellent value.
