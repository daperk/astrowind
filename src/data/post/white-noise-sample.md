## The Science of Sleep Sounds

Sound masking works by creating a consistent acoustic blanket that prevents your brain from being startled awake by sudden environmental noises. Different "colors" of noise offer distinct benefits.

## Types of Sleep Sounds

**White Noise**: Contains all frequencies at equal power, creating the classic static sound. Best for masking sudden, disruptive noises like traffic or neighbors.

**Pink Noise**: Reduces higher frequencies for a deeper, more natural sound similar to rainfall or rustling leaves. Research shows it may enhance deep sleep and memory consolidation.

**Brown Noise**: Even deeper than pink noise, resembling low rumbles like thunder or ocean waves. Particularly effective for some people with racing thoughts.

## Choosing Your Sound Solution

Dedicated sound machines typically outperform phone apps because they don't emit electromagnetic fields near your head and won't be disrupted by notifications.

Position your sound machine 6-8 feet from your bed at a comfortable volume—loud enough to mask disruptive sounds but not so loud it becomes a sleep disruptor itself. Experiment with different noise colors to find what works best for you.
