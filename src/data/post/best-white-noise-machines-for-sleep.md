White noise machines mask disruptive sounds and create a consistent audio environment for deeper, uninterrupted sleep. Here's how to choose the right one.

## Why White Noise Works

Sudden noises—dogs barking, traffic, neighbors—wake you by creating contrast with silence. White noise eliminates that contrast by providing a consistent sound blanket.

### Science-backed benefits:
- Masks environmental noise disruptions
- Helps babies and light sleepers stay asleep
- Improves sleep onset time
- Reduces nighttime awakenings

## Types of Noise: White, Pink, and Brown

Not all noise is created equal.

### White Noise
- **Sound**: High-frequency, like static or a fan
- **Best for**: Masking sharp, sudden sounds (voices, car horns)
- **Can be**: Slightly harsh for sensitive ears

### Pink Noise
- **Sound**: Deeper, more balanced (rain, ocean waves)
- **Best for**: Natural, soothing background sound
- **Research shows**: May improve deep sleep and memory

### Brown Noise
- **Sound**: Low-frequency, like a waterfall or distant thunder
- **Best for**: Very calming, great for focus and sleep
- **Preference**: Many find it less irritating than white noise

## Best Dedicated White Noise Machines

### LectroFan EVO
- **Price**: ~$50
- **Sounds**: 22 white, pink, and brown noise variations
- **Volume**: Extremely loud when needed (great for noisy environments)
- **Battery**: Plug-in only
- **Verdict**: Best overall for variety and power

### Yogasleep Dohm Classic
- **Price**: ~$45
- **Sound**: Mechanical fan inside (authentic, non-looping)
- **Adjustability**: Dual-speed motor with tone adjustment
- **Nostalgia factor**: Original design from 1962
- **Verdict**: Best for natural, non-digital sound

### Hatch Restore
- **Price**: ~$130
- **Features**: Sound machine + sunrise alarm + smart light
- **App control**: Customize sounds, schedules, brightness
- **Sounds**: White noise, nature sounds, meditations
- **Verdict**: Best for all-in-one sleep environment control

### Adaptive Sound Technologies LectroSound
- **Price**: ~$80
- **Adaptive**: Listens to environment and adjusts volume automatically
- **Sounds**: 30 non-looping options
- **Travel-friendly**: Compact with USB charging
- **Verdict**: Best for travel and variable noise environments

## Budget Option: Use a Fan

A simple box fan provides natural white noise, airflow, and costs $20-40. It's low-tech, reliable, and doesn't require batteries or apps.

### Fan benefits:
- Genuine mechanical sound (non-digital)
- Temperature regulation from airflow
- No subscription or app required
- Can't break (fewer failure points)

## Apps vs. Dedicated Machines

**Apps** (myNoise, Dark Noise, White Noise Lite):
- **Pros**: Free or cheap, infinite variety
- **Cons**: Phone in bedroom (tempting to check), lower sound quality, battery drain

**Dedicated machines**:
- **Pros**: Better speakers, no phone needed, consistent volume
- **Cons**: Cost, another device to manage

**Winner**: Dedicated machines for bedroom use, apps for travel

## What to Look For

Prioritize:
1. **Sound quality**: Cheap speakers create tinny, harsh noise
2. **Volume range**: Must be loud enough to mask noises
3. **Non-looping**: Looping sounds can become noticeable and annoying
4. **Simplicity**: No complicated setup or apps required

## Features to Skip

Avoid gimmicks:
- Bluetooth connectivity (unnecessary complication)
- Too many sounds (you'll use 1-2 favorites anyway)
- Battery power (plug-in is more reliable for nightly use)

## Pro Tips for Maximum Effectiveness

1. **Place near the noise source**: Between you and the disruptive sound
2. **Not too loud**: Should mask noise without being jarring
3. **Use every night**: Consistency trains your brain to associate the sound with sleep
4. **Don't rely solely on apps**: Phone proximity disrupts sleep hygiene

## Final Recommendation

**Best for most people**: LectroFan EVO (variety + power)
**Best natural sound**: Yogasleep Dohm
**Best all-in-one**: Hatch Restore
**Best budget**: A simple fan

White noise machines are one of the highest ROI sleep investments—especially if you live in a noisy environment or are a light sleeper.
