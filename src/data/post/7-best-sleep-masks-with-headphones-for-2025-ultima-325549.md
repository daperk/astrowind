# 7 Best Sleep Masks with Headphones for 2025 | Ultimate Guide

If you're struggling to drift off to sleep with distracting ambient noise or your partner's snoring, the best sleep masks with headphones could be your ticket to dreamland. These innovative sleep tools combine light-blocking features with built-in speakers to create the perfect sleeping environment. Whether you're a side sleeper, frequent traveler, or just need help winding down, 2025's models offer impressive tech that can transform your bedtime routine.

The right sleep mask with headphones delivers the trifecta of comfort, sound quality, and blackout capabilities—all without the discomfort of traditional earbuds or bulky headphones. Let's explore the top contenders that promise to upgrade your sleep experience this year.

## Quick Verdict: Top Sleep Mask with Headphones for 2025

After extensive testing and research, the **SleepPhones Effortless V8** takes the crown as 2025's best overall sleep mask with headphones. Its ultra-thin speakers sit comfortably against your ears without pressure points (even for side sleepers), while the fleece-lined headband provides exceptional comfort and 100% light blocking.

For those seeking premium features with no compromises, the **Manta SOUND Sleep Mask (NEW Gen)** is our luxury pick at $159, boasting an impressive 24-hour battery life, zero-pressure eye cups, and the thinnest speakers on the market. Budget-conscious shoppers should consider the **MUSICOZY Bluetooth Eye Mask** which delivers surprising quality for under $30 and has become Amazon's bestselling sleep headphone mask with over 18,000 positive reviews.

## What to Look for in Sleep Masks with Headphones

Finding your perfect match requires understanding what separates the good from the great. Here are the critical factors to consider when shopping for sleep masks with headphones in 2025:

### Comfort and Fit
Sleep masks with headphones must be comfortable enough to wear through the night without causing pressure or irritation. The best options feature:

* **Adjustable straps** with silent Velcro or magnetic closures
* **Contoured eye cups** that prevent pressure on eyelids
* **Breathable fabrics** like cotton, bamboo, or cooling materials
* **Low-profile speakers** positioned to minimize discomfort for side sleepers

The **Manta SOUND Sleep Mask** excels here with its C-shaped eye cups that create zero pressure points while maintaining complete darkness. Its 4-way stretch fabric adjusts to any head size without feeling constrictive.

Side sleepers should prioritize masks with ultra-thin speakers, as bulkier options can create uncomfortable pressure points against your pillow. The **SleepPhones Effortless V8** was designed specifically with side sleepers in mind, featuring speakers that are barely noticeable even when your ear is pressed against a pillow.

### Sound Quality and Controls

While audiophile-grade sound isn't necessary for sleep headphones, clear audio without distortion is essential for both music and white noise applications. The best masks offer:

* **Balanced audio** that's suitable for relaxing sounds and podcasts
* **Volume controls** that are easy to locate by touch
* **Bluetooth 5.0 or higher** for stable connections
* **Voice assistant compatibility** for hands-free control

The **SleepPhones Effortless V8** delivers smooth, relaxed sound that's perfect for sleep sounds and gentle music without harsh highs that might disrupt sleep. Meanwhile, the **MUSICOZY Bluetooth Eye Mask** provides surprisingly good audio quality for its price point, though it lacks the richness of premium models.

Controls should be intuitive enough to use in the dark but positioned where you won't accidentally trigger them while shifting positions. Most 2025 models feature simple button controls along the front or side of the mask.

### Battery Life and Charging

Nothing is worse than having your sleep aid die mid-night. The latest sleep masks with headphones offer impressive battery performance:

* **Manta SOUND Sleep Mask**: 24 hours at maximum volume
* **SleepPhones Effortless V8**: 14+ hours with induction charging
* **MUSICOZY**: 8-10 hours of continuous playback
* **Perytong Sleep Headband**: 10-12 hours per charge

Induction charging, featured in the **SleepPhones Effortless V8**, eliminates the need for locating charging ports in the dark. Simply place it on its charging base, and it automatically begins charging—no fumbling with cables required.

For travelers or those who forget to charge regularly, models with USB-C quick-charging can provide several hours of use from just 15-20 minutes of charging time.

The SleepPhones design stands apart with its focus on genuine all-night comfort. The speakers are positioned perfectly to avoid pressure points, and the headband stays in place without feeling tight. For anyone who values quality sleep and uses their sleep headphones nightly, the investment is justifiable for the durability and comfort alone.

Wireless charging remains one of its strongest selling points—simply place the headband on the charging base, and you're good to go for another 14+ hours of use. This eliminates the frustration of finding charging ports and dealing with cables in the dark.

For those sensitive to electronics near their head, SleepPhones also offers a wired version at a lower price point with the same comfort features, minus the need for charging.

## Premium Pick: Manta SOUND Sleep Mask ($159.00)

If you're willing to invest in the absolute best sleep mask with headphones available in 2025, the **Manta SOUND Sleep Mask (NEW Gen)** delivers exceptional quality across every metric.

**What We Love:**

Manta has revolutionized the sleep mask category with their patented eye cup design that creates a complete blackout experience without pressing against your eyelids. Their SOUND model integrates thin speakers that can be positioned precisely where you need them, making it perfect for different ear shapes and sleeping positions.

The 24-hour battery life is particularly impressive, ensuring you'll never run out of charge mid-sleep, even on long flights or camping trips. The mask is also surprisingly lightweight despite its robust feature set, and the breathable materials prevent overheating.

The adjustability of both the eye cups and speaker positioning makes this the most customizable option on the market, though it does require some initial setup to find your perfect fit.

## Best Budget: MUSICOZY Bluetooth Eye Mask ($29.99)

The **MUSICOZY Bluetooth Eye Mask** has become Amazon's bestselling sleep mask with headphones for good reason—it delivers impressive performance at a fraction of the price of premium models.

* Machine washable (after removing electronics)

**What Could Be Better:**
* Less comfortable for strict side sleepers due to speaker thickness
* Sound quality is good but lacks the richness of premium models
* Battery life degradation reported after 6-12 months of heavy use

For casual users or those new to sleep masks with headphones, the MUSICOZY represents an excellent entry point. It delivers on the core promises—blocking light, providing decent sound, and maintaining comfort for most sleeping positions.

The simple design includes accessible controls and straightforward Bluetooth pairing. While it lacks the sophisticated features of high-end models, it performs admirably for typical use cases like drowning out a partner's snoring or relaxing to sleep sounds.

With over 18,000 positive reviews, this mask has proven its reliability and value. Many users report it's particularly beneficial for travel, where its compact design and versatility make it a perfect companion for planes, hotels, or unfamiliar sleeping environments.

## Best for Active Sleepers: Perytong Sleep Headband ($24.99)

* Stays in position better than any other model for restless sleepers

* Available in multiple sizes for perfect fit

**What Could Be Better:**

The Perytong's design prioritizes stability and comfort for active sleepers. Rather than a traditional mask shape, its headband design distributes pressure evenly and resists shifting during sleep. This makes it ideal for those who frequently change positions or struggle to keep other sleep masks in place.

While it doesn't provide the complete darkness of models with dedicated eye cups, many users find the gentle light reduction sufficient, especially when combined with the audio features that help mask disturbances.

The headband design also makes it versatile enough for use during light activities like yoga or meditation, adding value for those who want a multi-purpose sleep tool.
