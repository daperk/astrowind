## The Power of Consistency

Your circadian rhythm thrives on predictability. Research from Johns Hopkins Sleep Center shows that going to bed and waking at the same time every day—including weekends—is the single most effective sleep habit you can develop. This consistency reinforces your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.

## The 90-Minute Wind-Down Protocol

Start your routine 90 minutes before your target sleep time. This matches your body's natural ultradian rhythm and allows for gradual physiological changes needed for quality sleep.

**60-90 minutes before bed**: Dim your lights to 50% or less. This signals your pineal gland to begin melatonin production. Avoid screens or use blue light blocking glasses if screen time is unavoidable.

**30-60 minutes before bed**: Engage in relaxing activities like reading, gentle stretching, or journaling. These low-stimulation activities help transition your nervous system from "fight or flight" to "rest and digest" mode.

**Final 30 minutes**: Prepare your sleep environment—cool temperature (65°F), complete darkness, and minimal noise. Use this time for personal hygiene and any calming meditation or breathing exercises.

## Common Routine Mistakes

Avoid intense exercise, large meals, or stressful conversations within three hours of bedtime. These activities spike cortisol and core body temperature, directly opposing your body's natural sleep preparation. Even one late workout can disrupt sleep patterns for 2-3 nights.
