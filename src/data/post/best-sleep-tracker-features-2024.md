## What Makes a Sleep Tracker Worth Buying

Modern sleep trackers have evolved far beyond simple step counters. The best devices now offer multi-sensor arrays that monitor heart rate variability (HRV), blood oxygen levels (SpO2), skin temperature, and movement patterns to provide comprehensive sleep analysis.

## Must-Have Features for Accurate Tracking

**Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Monitoring**: This metric reveals how well your nervous system recovers during sleep. Higher HRV generally indicates better sleep quality and physical recovery. Look for trackers that measure HRV continuously throughout the night, not just at intervals.

**Sleep Stage Detection**: Advanced algorithms use movement and heart rate data to differentiate between light sleep, deep sleep, and REM cycles. Accurate staging helps you understand whether you're getting restorative deep sleep and sufficient REM for memory consolidation.

**Blood Oxygen Monitoring**: SpO2 tracking can detect potential breathing disruptions like sleep apnea, where oxygen levels drop during the night. This feature has become increasingly important for identifying undiagnosed sleep disorders.

## Features That Don't Matter

Ignore marketing hype around "proprietary sleep scores" that lack scientific validation. Focus instead on raw data access and trends over time. The best tracker is one you'll actually wear consistently—comfort matters more than fancy features you'll never use.
