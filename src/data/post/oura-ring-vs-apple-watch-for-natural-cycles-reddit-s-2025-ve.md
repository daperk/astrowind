### Accuracy for Natural Cycles

The Oura Ring measures skin temperature deviations from your baseline rather than absolute basal body temperature (BBT). Research from Natural Cycles' clinical validation studies shows these relative changes are reliable indicators of hormonal shifts, with effectiveness rates comparable to traditional BBT methods when used consistently.

Reddit users frequently report that Oura's temperature tracking feels more reliable than Apple Watch, particularly because it's worn on the finger rather than the wrist, which can be affected by environmental factors.

### Sleep Tracking Performance

Sleep tracking is where the Oura Ring truly shines. Its lightweight design means you barely notice it while sleeping, and users report minimal disruption to natural sleep positions. The device provides:

- Detailed sleep stage breakdown (deep, REM, light)
- Sleep efficiency score
- Respiratory rate monitoring
- Heart rate variability (HRV) during sleep
- Body temperature variations

Many Reddit users note seeing temperature changes align perfectly with their menstrual cycles within 1-2 months of consistent use.

### Pros & Cons

**Pros:**
- Extremely comfortable during sleep
- Longer battery life (charge just 1-2 times weekly)
- More detailed sleep metrics than Apple Watch
- Discreet design with no screen or notifications
- Works with both iOS and Android
- Special discount for Natural Cycles users

**Cons:**
- Requires $5.99/month subscription for full data access
- No screen for real-time feedback
- Limited daytime fitness tracking compared to Apple Watch
- Higher upfront cost than some competitors

## Apple Watch Series 10 Review

### Specifications & Features

- **Price**: $399 (GPS) / $499 (GPS + Cellular)

- **Temperature Sensors**: Dual-sided wrist temperature sensing
- **Weight**: 31.9g (aluminum 41mm case)
- **Water Resistance**: 50m
- **Natural Cycles Integration**: Direct temperature data sharing (Series 8 or newer required)

### Accuracy for Natural Cycles

Apple Watch Series 8 and newer models include temperature sensors specifically designed for cycle tracking. Like the Oura Ring, the Watch measures relative temperature changes rather than absolute BBT. Natural Cycles' integration with Apple Watch began in 2023 and has improved significantly in 2025, with algorithms specifically calibrated for wrist-based measurements.

Reddit users note that Apple Watch requires more consistent wear patterns to establish reliable baselines, with several mentioning that removing the watch even briefly before sleep can impact readings.

### Sleep Tracking Performance

The Apple Watch provides comprehensive sleep tracking, though users consistently mention comfort issues compared to the ring form factor:

- Sleep stages (deep, core, REM)
- Sleep efficiency metrics
- Respiratory rate
- Heart rate monitoring
- Wrist temperature variations

The primary challenge reported on Reddit is the need to charge daily, which can interrupt consistent tracking if not managed carefully.

### Pros & Cons

**Pros:**
- Multifunctional with apps, notifications, and calling
- Superior daytime fitness tracking
- No monthly subscription required
- Seamless integration with iPhone and Apple Health
- More robust health alerts (irregular heartbeat, falls)
- Larger screen for immediate data viewing

**Cons:**
