## The Power of Habit

Consistent sleep habits are more powerful than any single sleep hack or gadget. Your circadian rhythm thrives on predictability, and establishing regular patterns is the foundation of excellent sleep.

## Core Sleep Habits

**Consistent Schedule**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends. This single habit has the most significant impact on sleep quality.

**Pre-Sleep Routine**: Create a 60-90 minute wind-down period that signals to your body it's time to sleep. This might include dimming lights, reading, gentle stretching, or meditation.

**Morning Routine**: Start your day with bright light exposure within 30 minutes of waking to set your circadian rhythm anchor point.

## Making Habits Stick

Start small with just one habit change. Once that becomes automatic (typically 2-4 weeks), add another. Trying to overhaul everything at once usually leads to burnout and reverting to old patterns.

Track your progress in a simple journal or app to maintain awareness and celebrate small wins along the way.
