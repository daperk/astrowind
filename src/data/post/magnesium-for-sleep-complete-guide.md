## Why Magnesium Matters for Sleep

Magnesium activates the parasympathetic nervous system, responsible for calm and relaxation. It regulates neurotransmitters that send signals throughout your brain and body, including GABA—the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter that promotes sleep. Studies suggest nearly 50% of Americans don't meet the recommended daily intake of magnesium.

## The Sleep-Magnesium Connection

Research published in the *Journal of Research in Medical Sciences* found that magnesium supplementation improved subjective measures of insomnia, including sleep efficiency, sleep time, and early morning awakening. Participants also showed increased renin and melatonin levels, which help regulate sleep.

Magnesium deficiency correlates with poor sleep quality, restless leg syndrome, and frequent nighttime awakenings. Even subclinical deficiency can impair sleep architecture without obvious symptoms.

## Best Forms for Sleep

**Magnesium Glycinate**: Most bioavailable and least likely to cause digestive issues. The glycine component also has calming properties that enhance sleep quality.

**Magnesium Threonate**: Crosses the blood-brain barrier most effectively, potentially offering superior central nervous system benefits for sleep and cognition.

**Avoid Magnesium Oxide**: Poor absorption rate (only 4% bioavailable) and likely to cause laxative effects.

## Optimal Dosing Protocol

Take 200-400mg of elemental magnesium 30-60 minutes before bed. Start with a lower dose (200mg) and increase gradually if needed. Pair with a small amount of fat for better absorption. Be patient—full effects may take 2-4 weeks of consistent supplementation to manifest.
