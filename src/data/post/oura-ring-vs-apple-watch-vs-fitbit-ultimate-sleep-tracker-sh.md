### Oura Ring Gen 3

**Price**: $349-$549 (depending on finish) + $5.99/month membership

**Key Specs:**
- Form factor: Ring (sized with sizing kit)
- Battery life: 4-7 days (depending on features used)
- Water resistance: Up to 100m
- Sensors: 3D accelerometer, gyroscope, optical heart rate monitor, temperature sensor
- Sleep metrics: Sleep stages, REM, deep and light sleep, breathing disturbances, HRV, body temperature

**Pros:**
- Most accurate sleep stage detection (~80% agreement with lab polysomnography)
- Extremely comfortable for 24/7 wear including sleep
- No bright screen to disrupt sleep
- Impressive 4-7 day battery life
- Detailed recovery metrics including HRV and temperature

**Cons:**

The **Oura Ring** stands out as the sleep tracking specialist of the group. Its placement on your finger allows for more accurate pulse readings compared to wrist-based trackers, which translates to superior sleep stage detection. In a clinical study published in 2023, the Oura Ring matched polysomnography readings with approximately 80% accuracy—significantly better than wrist-based alternatives.

During my testing, I found the Oura provided the most consistent and detailed sleep data, particularly for identifying deep sleep phases, which many trackers struggle to detect accurately. The morning readiness score, which combines sleep quality, HRV, resting heart rate, and body temperature, offered genuinely useful guidance on how hard to push myself each day.

The discreet ring format means there's no screen to disturb you (or your partner) at night, and the comfort level is exceptional—within 2-3 days, I completely forgot I was wearing it. The 4-7 day battery life means you're not constantly concerned about charging, which helps maintain continuous tracking.

The main drawbacks? There's no display for quick checks, making it less useful for active fitness tracking, and the $5.99 monthly subscription is required to access most of the valuable insights. However, if your primary focus is sleep and recovery, the Oura Ring remains the gold standard in consumer sleep tracking in 2025.

### Apple Watch Series 10/Ultra 2

**Price**: $399-$799 (Series 10, depending on size/connectivity); $799-$899 (Ultra 2)

**Key Specs:**
- Form factor: Wrist watch (41mm or 45mm for Series 10; 49mm for Ultra 2)
- Battery life: Up to 18 hours (Series 10); up to 36 hours (Ultra 2)
- Water resistance: 50m
- Sensors: Optical heart rate, ECG, temperature, accelerometer, gyroscope, altimeter, blood oxygen
- Sleep metrics: Sleep stages, respiratory rate, sleep consistency, breathing disturbances, sleep apnea detection

**Pros:**
- Excellent all-around health and fitness ecosystem
- Superior workout tracking with real-time metrics
- Advanced health alerts (ECG, AFib, fall detection, crash detection, apnea detection)
- Full smartwatch functionality with numerous apps
- No mandatory subscription

**Cons:**
- Short battery life requires daily/nightly charging
- Less accurate sleep staging than Oura (particularly for deep sleep)
- Bulkier to wear while sleeping
- Higher price point, especially for cellular models

The **Apple Watch** has evolved into a capable sleep tracker over the years, though sleep isn't its primary strength. During my tests, the Apple Watch reliably detected when I fell asleep and woke up, but consistently underestimated my deep sleep compared to both the Oura Ring and clinical benchmarks. For instance, on nights where Oura detected over 2 hours of deep sleep (aligned with my subjective experience), the Apple Watch often reported just 55-60 minutes.

Where Apple Watch excels is in its broader health ecosystem. The Series 10 offers potentially life-saving features like ECG readings, fall detection, and the new sleep apnea detection—features neither Oura nor Fitbit can match. The sleep apnea detection is particularly noteworthy, as it can identify breathing disturbances that might indicate a serious health condition affecting approximately 30% of men and 15% of women.

The watch also offers superior workout tracking with over 100 exercise types and real-time metrics displayed on your wrist. This makes it an excellent choice for those who want one device to track both active exercise and sleep.

The biggest limitation for sleep is battery life. With just 18 hours of typical use (36 for the Ultra 2), you'll need to develop a charging routine that doesn't interfere with sleep tracking. Most users charge in the morning while showering and getting ready, though this can create gaps in your 24-hour health data.

### Fitbit Charge 6/Sense 2/Versa 4

**Price**: $159.95 (Charge 6); $299.95 (Sense 2); $229.95 (Versa 4) + $9.99/month for Fitbit Premium

**Key Specs:**
- Form factor: Wristband (Charge 6) or watch (Sense 2/Versa 4)
- Battery life: Up to 7 days (Charge 6); up to 6 days (Sense 2/Versa 4)
- Water resistance: 50m
- Sensors: Optical heart rate, SpO2, skin temperature (Sense 2), ECG (Sense 2)
- Sleep metrics: Sleep stages, Sleep Score, restlessness, breathing rate

**Pros:**
- Most affordable entry point
- Good battery life (better than Apple Watch)
- Solid activity tracking integrated with sleep data
- Simple, accessible sleep insights
- Works with both Android and iOS

**Cons:**
- Sleep stage accuracy trails Oura
- Requires Premium subscription for detailed sleep insights
- Less advanced health sensors than Apple Watch
- Manual workout tracking needed for many activities

**Fitbit** devices sit between the specialized sleep focus of Oura and the full-featured smartwatch approach of Apple Watch. In my testing, Fitbit devices reliably tracked sleep duration and offered a digestible Sleep Score that combines duration, stages, and restlessness. However, when compared to Oura and polysomnography data, Fitbit devices showed more inconsistency in sleep stage detection, particularly tending to overestimate REM sleep on many nights.

The Charge 6 is Fitbit's latest band-style tracker and offers exceptional value for those primarily interested in sleep and basic activity tracking. The Sense 2 adds more advanced health features like ECG and stress tracking, while the Versa 4 provides a smartwatch experience at a mid-range price point.

All Fitbit models offer significantly better battery life than the Apple Watch, typically lasting 6-7 days between charges, which is a huge advantage for continuous sleep tracking. The trackers are also relatively comfortable to wear overnight, though the rigid band designs can feel more intrusive than the Oura Ring.

One significant drawback is the Fitbit Premium subscription ($9.99/month), which is required to access detailed sleep insights like sleep stage breakdowns, sleeping heart rate, and restlessness data. Without Premium, you're limited to basic sleep duration and a simplified Sleep Score.
