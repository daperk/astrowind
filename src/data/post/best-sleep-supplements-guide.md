Supplements won't fix poor sleep hygiene, but they can accelerate improvements when used correctly. Here's what actually works.

For best results, pair every protocol here with supportive habits from our [Sleep Habits and Routines](/blog/sleep-habits-and-routines-that-work) guide and dial in your environment with the [bedroom optimization checklist](/blog/optimize-bedroom-environment-for-better-sleep).

## Magnesium: The Foundation Mineral

Magnesium deficiency is common and directly impacts sleep quality. It regulates GABA receptors and calms the nervous system.

### Best forms for sleep:
- **Magnesium Glycinate**: 200-400mg, highly absorbable, gentle on digestion
- **Magnesium Threonate**: 140-200mg elemental, crosses blood-brain barrier
- **Magnesium Citrate**: 300-400mg, more laxative effect (good if constipated)

**Timing**: 1-2 hours before bed with a small snack

## L-Theanine: Calm Focus Without Sedation

This amino acid from tea promotes alpha brain waves and reduces stress without drowsiness.

### How to use:
- **Dose**: 200-400mg
- **Timing**: Evening or 30-60 minutes before bed
- **Stacks well with**: Magnesium or GABA

## Glycine: The Underrated Sleep Aid

Glycine lowers core body temperature and improves sleep quality without making you groggy.

### Protocol:
- **Dose**: 3-5 grams
- **Form**: Powder mixed in water (nearly tasteless)
- **Timing**: 30-60 minutes before bed
- **Bonus**: May improve morning alertness

## Melatonin: Use Strategically, Not Nightly

Melatonin is a sleep-timing signal, not a sedative. Most people use too much, too often.

### Smart melatonin use:
- **Low dose works best**: 0.3-1mg (not 5-10mg)
- **Best for**: Jet lag, shift work, circadian rhythm reset
- **Timing**: 2-3 hours before desired bedtime
- **Avoid**: Daily long-term use (can suppress natural production)

## Apigenin: The Chamomile Extract

The active compound in chamomile tea, concentrated for effectiveness.

### Details:
- **Dose**: 50mg
- **Effect**: Gentle GABAergic activity
- **Combine with**: Magnesium and L-theanine for synergy

## Adaptogens for Stress-Related Insomnia

If cortisol or stress keeps you awake:
- **Ashwagandha**: 300-600mg (KSM-66 or Sensoril extract)
- **Rhodiola**: Morning use for better evening sleep
- **Reishi mushroom**: 1-1.5g before bed for calm

## What NOT to Take

Avoid these overhyped or risky options:
- **Valerian root**: Inconsistent quality, can cause grogginess
- **CBD**: Minimal evidence for sleep, expensive, unregulated
- **5-HTP**: Can deplete other neurotransmitters long-term
- **High-dose melatonin**: More isn't better

## Stacking for Maximum Effect

A simple, effective stack:
1. Magnesium Glycinate (300mg)
2. L-Theanine (200mg)
3. Glycine (3g)

Take 60-90 minutes before bed with a small snack.

## Always Consult a Professional

If you have medical conditions, take medications, or are pregnant/nursing, consult your doctor before starting any supplement regimen.

Supplements work best as part of a comprehensive sleep strategy—not as a standalone fix.
