## The Foundation of Great Sleep

Your sleep environment plays a crucial role in determining sleep quality. Research shows that optimizing your bedroom can improve sleep onset time by up to 40% and increase overall sleep quality significantly.

## Key Environmental Factors

**Temperature Control**: Maintain your bedroom between 60-67°F (15-19°C). Your body's core temperature naturally drops during sleep, and a cooler room facilitates this process.

**Light Management**: Complete darkness is essential for melatonin production. Use blackout curtains or a sleep mask to block all light sources, including LED indicators from electronics.

**Sound Optimization**: Minimize disruptive noises or use white noise machines to create a consistent acoustic environment that masks sudden sounds.

## Implementation Strategy

Start by addressing the most impactful factors first. Install blackout curtains, set your thermostat appropriately, and remove or cover electronic devices that emit light. These simple changes can dramatically transform your sleep quality within just a few nights.
