## The Science of Sleep Temperature

Your body's core temperature naturally drops when you sleep, signaling your brain that it's time to rest. Research shows the optimal bedroom temperature for quality sleep falls between 60-67°F (15.6-19.4°C), with most sleep experts recommending around 65°F (18.3°C) as the sweet spot.

## Why Temperature Matters

When your bedroom is too warm, your body struggles to initiate the temperature drop needed for deep sleep. This can lead to restless nights, frequent awakenings, and reduced REM sleep cycles. Conversely, a room that's too cold can cause muscle tension and discomfort.

Studies published in the journal *Sleep* demonstrate that even a few degrees above or below the optimal range can reduce sleep efficiency by up to 10%. Your body works harder to regulate temperature, preventing you from achieving restorative deep sleep stages.

## Practical Tips for Temperature Control

Start by setting your thermostat to 65°F before bedtime. Use breathable, moisture-wicking bedding materials like cotton or bamboo to help regulate body heat. Consider a programmable thermostat that gradually lowers temperature as bedtime approaches, mimicking your body's natural rhythm.

For budget-conscious solutions, strategic fan placement and blackout curtains can significantly impact room temperature without increasing energy costs.
