## Understanding Sleep Supplements

Sleep supplements can be effective tools when used correctly, but they're not magic pills. Understanding which supplements have scientific backing and how to use them properly is essential.

## Research-Backed Supplements

**Magnesium Glycinate**: This highly bioavailable form of magnesium helps activate the parasympathetic nervous system and improves sleep quality. Take 200-400mg 30-60 minutes before bed.

**L-Theanine**: An amino acid found in tea that promotes relaxation without sedation. It works synergistically with magnesium and is generally safe for nightly use.

**Melatonin**: Use only 0.5-1mg (not the common 5-10mg doses) taken 2-3 hours before desired sleep time. Higher doses can cause grogginess and tolerance.

## Safe Usage Guidelines

Always consult healthcare providers before starting supplements, especially if you take medications or have health conditions. Start with the lowest effective dose and give each supplement 2-4 weeks before evaluating effectiveness.

Supplements work best when combined with good sleep habits and environmental optimization rather than as standalone solutions.
